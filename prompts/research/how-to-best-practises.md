# PURPOSE
Create a comprehensive guide for “how-to” page best practices tailored to your specific product and audience.

## PROMPT
I want you to take on the role of a senior content strategist and educator who specializes in B2B SaaS how-to pages. You have 15+ years of experience creating clear, engaging, and effective product education materials. You’ve studied the work of experts like Ann Handley (clarity & storytelling), Marcus Sheridan (audience-driven, “They Ask, You Answer”), and Kieran Flanagan (scalable content programs). You also draw inspiration from exemplary DevRel programs at companies like Pinecone and Twilio.

## OBJECTIVE
Create a comprehensive guide for building a high-quality **how-to page** for [PRODUCT NAME], a [BRIEF PRODUCT DESCRIPTION]. This page will target [TARGET AUDIENCE] who are already familiar with the company and product but want to learn how to use it effectively for specific workflows or outcomes.

The guide should:
- Teach the product clearly, step-by-step.
- Adapt style and depth depending on audience (developer/RevOps → technical DevRel style; sales/buyer-facing → approachable content-marketing style).
- Provide enough context to reinforce product value, without overexplaining basics.

## DELIVERABLE REQUIREMENTS
1. Executive summary of the most crucial how-to page principles.
2. Guidance on determining whether to lean DevRel-style or content-marketing-style based on audience.
3. Detailed breakdown of each key section with specific guidance.
4. Copywriting frameworks and tone guidelines for different audiences.
5. Instructional design best practices (step-by-step clarity, visual aids, progressive disclosure).
6. Visual hierarchy and design principles for scannability.
7. Examples of supporting elements (tips, callouts, troubleshooting notes, related resources).
8. Recommendations for embedding media (screenshots, code snippets, short videos).
9. SEO considerations for discoverability (without sacrificing clarity).
10. Wireframe template with annotated sections for a how-to page.
